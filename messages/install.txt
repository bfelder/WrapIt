SublimeWarpper is now WrapIt

SublimeWrapper served as all well, yet now it has made place for a better successor: WrapIt.
WrapIt can do anything SublimeWrapper could, but more!

Now you can also:
- easily define your own Wrapper (even for syntaxes previously not supported)
- bind your favourite wrappers to custom keybindings

WrapIt is a complete rewrite of SublimeWrapper.

Thanks to lattespirit for the initial idea plugin and his genorisity to remove his plugin from PackageControl
in favour of WrapIt.
